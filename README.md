# move-files-from-folder
Move specific file types from folder/directory on MacOS Apple Script and Automator - folder actions

I created this in an attempt to automatically sort and clean up some downloaded files.
It's relatively simple yet I wasn't able to find a resource that explained how to do what I wanted.

Open automator and select folder actions
select bash script and add it to the folder action to run when a file is added to the folder you specify in the script.
